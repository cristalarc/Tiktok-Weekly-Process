-- To Do--
Add specific TTPID funcitionality to weekly processor
Add COGS value to the samples financial metrics

Add cases in which a file isn't found, should it proceed?

The user will pick the ASIN from a dropdown list and run it.
    When the process is ran, the script will fetch all the values for LW financial metrics
    and paste the values where its expected
    The script will handle the creation of a new column

    Add functionality to run all ASINs with one button

Identify if SKU ID is the best identifier accross all files
Relative files paths need to be fetched from a dialog box OR the name needs to be dynamic.
We'lll have to add something to improve the UI so that users dont select a TTPID but a name

--Optimization--
Make the Catalog section self suficient via import file instead of hard coded ASIN and SKUs
